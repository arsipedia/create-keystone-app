## Lesson X0: Add a simple frontend app

> In this lesson we will add a frontend app that calls the graphql endpoint

> WARN: Thinkmill uses next and apollo as our stack. This example uses these tools, however Keystone works with any frontend or graphql request

- pick up from lesson 0
- `yarn add next react react-dom`
- create `pages/index.js`
- add a react component to the index saying it will list all the current blog posts to that page
- `install urql`
